# Image-Classification_cnn
Problem Statement: Imagine you’re a fashion designer, and your model has created 1000s of different shoes, shirts, accessories etc. 
Now I’ve decided to open an online website for my products, and so photos need to be taken for these products, and label them. 
Let’s say you have these products labelled but do you have these products labelled with the specifics the online platform demands? 
And if I suppose want to add more and more photos then it would be nice if the labelling can be automated and stream lined. 
Let’s say you have a website, where people can sell their clothes, but any person can join and upload what they want to sell, but these people don’t take their time to label their products. 
This can prove to be a problem for me, since the consumers may struggle to find the items, and the platform losses ground to competition. 
So, I decide to create a model that can assign these products their correct labels. This illustrates the significance of the image classification problem.
